# go-email

I was inspired by [polo2ro imapbox](https://github.com/polo2ro/imapbox) to create a way to download my email to a folder and I wanted to build it in Golang

## Getting started

## How to install

1. Using go install

    ```bash
    # for latest
    go install github.com/rogafe/go-email@latest

    #for latest working release :)
    go install github.com/rogafe/go-email@v0.1.2

    ```

2. Using the automatic release

   *Only for linux for now* checkout the [releases](https://github.com/rogafe/go-email/releases) page.
