# go-email

I was inspired by [polo2ro imapbox](https://github.com/polo2ro/imapbox) to create a way to download my email to a folder and I wanted to build it in Golang

## Getting started


How to install 

Using go install

```bash
# for latest
go install github.com/rogafe/go-email@latest

#for latest working release :)
go install github.com/rogafe/go-email@v0.1.2

```
